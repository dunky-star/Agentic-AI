# Agentic AI - From Novice to Expert

This repository contains code examples, reference scripts, and foundational components for exploring  the Agentic AI. Marking the transition from traditional prompt pipelines to building **agent-based AI systems** using tools like **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **LangSmith**.


Introduces the core building blocks of agentic systems and prepares you for more complex workflows in later modules. Let's explore:

- The **workflow-to-agent spectrum** and when to use agentic architectures.
- The fundamentals of **LangGraph** and how to structure applications as stateful graphs.
- The role of **LangSmith** in debugging, tracing, and evaluating agent runs.
- Built-in and **custom tool development** for dynamic agent behavior.
